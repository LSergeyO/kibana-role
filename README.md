Kibana
=========

Simple download binaries from official website and install elasticsearch.

Role Variables
--------------
There is only two variables that you can redefine in your playbook.
```yaml

```

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

```yaml
- hosts: all
  roles:
      - kibana
```
